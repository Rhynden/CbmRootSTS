/** @class CbmStsSensorDssd
 ** @brief Class describing double-sided silicon strip sensors.
 ** @author V.Friese <v.friese@gsi.de>
 ** @version 1.0
 **
 ** Abstract class describes the (analogue) response of double-sided silicon
 ** strip sensors in the STS.
 **
 ** The active area does not necessarily coincide with the geometric
 ** dimensions of the sensor. It is, however, centred in the latter,
 ** meaning that the width of inactive regions (guard ring) are
 ** the same on the left and on the right side and also the same at
 ** the top and and the bottom.
 **
 ** The response to charged particles is modelled by a uniform charge
 ** distribution along the particle trajectory in the active volume,
 ** which is projected to the readout edge, where it is discretised
 ** on the active strips. The charge is then delivered to the corresponding
 ** channel of the readout module (CbmStsModule).
 **
 ** This is an abstract class, since additional functionality, depending
 ** on where (on which edge) the readout is done. Derived classes have to
 ** implement the pure virtual method PropagateCharge, which has to
 ** properly fill the charge arrays fStripCharge for front and back side,
 ** along with the auxiliary method Diffusion for the thermal diffusion
 ** along the drift to the readout plane. Also, the mapping from the strip
 ** numbers to the (module) channel number has to be implemented in
 ** GetModuleChannel and GetStrip. These methods will e.g. be different
 ** for sensors with stereo angles, where both sides are read out at the
 ** same edge, and for sensor with orthogonal strips, where the back plane
 ** is read out at the left or right edge.
